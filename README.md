==================================
The module consists of three web pages. The main page, found [here](http://ec2-54-205-135-226.compute-1.amazonaws.com/index.php),
contains the most important component, listing seminars by the designations described above. These features, crucially,
are able to be sorted by date, time, department, speaker information, food availability, and location, as mentioned above.

A key feature of the homepage is that a simple click on an event will pop up a window with its geographical location
on the University of Rochester campus. This window also contains the aforementioned details of the event. Furthermore,
through this interface, if a user is interested, he can add the event to his directly to his Google calender with 1-click.

The last feature is a large map of the University of Rochester campus, located at the top right of the homepage, in order
to give a larger-scale bearing for a user or new student who is not familiar with the geography of the University.

Seminar info is user-submitted, and this portal can be accessed through the intuitive "Add a seminar" button, located
centrally in the page, as well as the "Add Seminar" button in the index at the top right-hand corner of the page. Seminars are automatically deleted the day after they have occured.
